### The Blog
The code is part of my SceneKit Tutorial Series: From Zero to Hero.
You find first tutorial at:

Remark: Code now updated to be Swift 3 compliant


### The Game
This tutorial is a companion work I do parallel on the development of my next upcoming 3D Game which uses just SceneKit and it's written entirely with Swift 3.

### For who is this Tutorial?
It's not for the absolute beginner or novice, because I assume things like Swift notation, trigonometric know-how etc. On the other hand you don't have to learn all at the begin. I have also started using some given classes without really understand the meaning. So it is with the terrain class RBTerrain. You can use it just like it is and read the code later again when you have more know-how. The most important is that you understand the principles.

### Introduction
It's important for me to start directly with a good and solid base which can be used for real Games later. So please don't create a project using the Xcode Project wizard but start directly with the Source on GitHub. Also I don't want to build a step by step tutorial which shows each line, but always cover a chapter of the Game and introduce a new component and show how and why :)
